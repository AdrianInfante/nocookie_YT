# nocookie_YT

## Overview

nocookie_YT is a Chrome extension that automatically modifies YouTube URLs to use `yout-ube.com` instead of `youtube.com` whenever you visit a YouTube video. The extension also refreshes the page after the URL has been changed to ensure the new URL is loaded, because not very often does.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/youtube-url-modifier.git

## Recent update

- Now, the background will extract the video ID from the initial url and will construct the new nocookie URL with the video ID
- The video will no longer autoreplay when it finish


## Known issues

- The video won't be available in certain conditions, but, it will be available after refreshing it. The extension will reload it 1 second after the video is called. (Working in a method to read when a video is/not available, instead of reloading it everytime)
